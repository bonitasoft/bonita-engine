/**
 * 
 *     <p>
 *         The Bonita BPM project has a clear separation between the API the users should be interacting with and the actual implementation classes.
 *         <br>
 *         The public API exposes most of the features we believe "normal" users can safely use and should remain rather stable across releases.
 *         <br>
 *         Expert users can still access internal classes but should be aware that they should know what they are doing and that the internal API might still change in the future.
