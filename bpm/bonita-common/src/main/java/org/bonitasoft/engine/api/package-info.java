/**
 * <p>
 * The Bonita project has a clear separation between the API the users should be interacting with and the actual
 * implementation classes.
 * <br>
 * The public API exposes most of the features we believe "normal" users can safely use and should remain rather stable
 * across releases.
 * <br>
 * Expert users can still access internal classes but should be aware that they should know what they are doing and that
 * the internal API might still change in the future.
