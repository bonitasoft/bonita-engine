#Do you want transaction logging to be enabled or not?
#If set to false, then no logging overhead will be done at the risk of losing data after restart or crash.
#Note: this setting may be overridden depending on your license!
#com.atomikos.icatch.enable_logging=false

#Set directory of log files; make sure this directory exists!
com.atomikos.icatch.log_base_dir = /target

#Set output directory where console file and other files are to be put make sure this directory exists!
com.atomikos.icatch.output_dir = /target

#Specifies the console log level. Defaults to WARN. Should be one of: WARN, INFO or DEBUG. 
#com.atomikos.icatch.console_log_level=WARN

#Set the max timeout (in milliseconds) for local transactions
#com.atomikos.icatch.max_timeout = 1000

#Do we want to use parallel subtransactions? JTA's default is NO for J2EE compatibility.
#com.atomikos.icatch.serial_jta_transactions=true

#Specifies whether or not to use different (and concurrent) threads for two-phase commit on the participating resources. 
#Setting this to true implies that the commit is more efficient since waiting for acknowledgements is done in parallel. 
#Defaults to true. If you set this to false, then commits will happen in the order that resources are accessed within the transaction.
#com.atomikos.icatch.threaded_2pc=true



#The default timeout for JTA transactions (optional, defaults to 10000 ms) 
#com.atomikos.icatch.default_jta_timeout=300000

#Set name of file where messages are output
#com.atomikos.icatch.console_file_name = tm.out

#Size limit (in bytes) for the console file; negative means unlimited.
#com.atomikos.icatch.console_file_limit=-1

#For size-limited console files, this option specifies a number of rotating files to maintain.
#com.atomikos.icatch.console_file_count=1

#Set the number of log writes between checkpoints
#com.atomikos.icatch.checkpoint_interval=500

#Set base name of log file this name will be used as the first part of the system-generated log file name
#com.atomikos.icatch.log_base_name = tmlog

#Set the max number of active local transactions or -1 for unlimited. Note: this may be overridden by your license!

#The globally unique name of this transaction manager process override this value with a globally unique name

#If you want to do explicit resource registration then you need to set this value to false. See later in this manual for what explicit resource registration means.
