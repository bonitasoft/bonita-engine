/**
 * Use ThreadPoolExecutor as ExecutorService
 * The handling of threads relies on the JVM
 * The rules to create new thread are:
 * - If the number of threads is less than the corePoolSize, create a new Thread to run a new task.
 * - If the number of threads is equal (or greater than) the corePoolSize, put the task into the queue.
 * - If the queue is full, and the number of threads is less than the maxPoolSize, create a new thread to run tasks in.
 * - If the queue is full, and the number of threads is greater than or equal to maxPoolSize, reject the task.
 * When the current number of threads are > than corePoolSize, they are kept idle during keepAliveTimeSeconds
