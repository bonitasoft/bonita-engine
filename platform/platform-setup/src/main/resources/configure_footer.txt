Remember that this command only works on bundles provided by Bonitasoft.
During the `configure` script execution, the setup tool verifies that the parent folder is a bundle.
If it is so:

For Tomcat, it:
   - sets db vendor + bdm db vendor in file server/bin/setenv (.sh|.bat)
   - sets all database configuration in file server/conf/bitronix-resources.properties
   - sets all database configuration in file server/conf/Catalina/localhost/bonita.xml
   - copies the required drivers from setup/lib/ to server/lib/bonita/

For Wildfly, it:
   - sets all database configuration in file standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
   - creates a module.xml file in server/modules/**/main/ folder, according to your database vendor
   - copies the required drivers from setup/lib/ to server/modules/**/main/


ADVANCED CONFIGURATION WARNING:
If you need to edit the server configuration, do not directly edit Tomcat files anymore, as they will be overwritten by the templates used by the setup tool.
Therefore, if you need to finely tune the server configuration, modify the following templates:

For Tomcat:
    - setup/tomcat-templates/bitronix-resources.properties
    - setup/tomcat-templates/bonita.xml
    - setup/tomcat-templates/setenv.sh
    - setup/tomcat-templates/setenv.bat

For Wildfly:
    - setup/wildfly-templates/standalone.xml
