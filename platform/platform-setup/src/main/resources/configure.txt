If you use the bonita-start script of Bonita BPM bundles, you don't need to run this command.
Use this command to configure the Application Server without the need for a manual configuration.

It only works on bundles provided by Bonitasoft.

The setup tool will verify if the parent folder is a bundle. If it is it will configure required files to use the datasource
of the setup tool.
For Tomcat:
   sets db vendor + bdm db vendor in file setenv.sh / .bat
   sets all database configuration in file conf/bitronix-resources.properties
   sets all database configuration in file conf/Catalina/localhost/bonita.xml
   copies the required drivers from setup/lib/ to lib/bonita/

For Wildfly:
   sets all database configuration in file standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
   create module.xml file in modules/**/main/ folder, according to your database vendor
   copies the required drivers from setup/lib/ to modules/**/main/

ADVANCED USER WARNING:
You do not need to configure Tomcat files directly anymore. This tool does it for you.
If you decide to do it anyway, the tool will overwrite your custom values.
If you need to finely tune the configuration, modify the following template files:

For Tomcat:
    setup/tomcat-templates/bitronix-resources.properties
    setup/tomcat-templates/bonita.xml
    setup/tomcat-templates/setenv.sh
    setup/tomcat-templates/setenv.bat
They are used as a basis for Tomcat configuration.

For Wildfly:
    setup/wildfly-templates/standalone.xml
It is used as a basis for Wildfly configuration.
